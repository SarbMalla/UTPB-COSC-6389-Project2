# UTPB-COSC-6389-Project2

## Description  
The provided Python code includes a simple implementation of a neural network. Your tasks are:  
- **Problem Selection**: Identify a binary classification or regression problem solvable with a neural network.  
- **Feature Extension**: Add new activation/cost functions and allow users to configure them via the UI during runtime.  
- **Visualization**: Ensure the network is displayed on a canvas and updates in real time as training progresses.

### Dataset
This project uses the Raisin Dataset, which contains features extracted from images of two raisin types: Besni and Kecimen. The dataset includes attributes like area, perimeter, and axis lengths, which are used to classify raisins into their respective categories using the implemented neural network.
